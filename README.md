The /data folder contains the test genomic sequences (.txt) and the results of all simulations to make the boxplots (.csv)

boxplot.py generates the boxplots (time and accuracy)

DNA_sequences_overlap_graph_ACS.py implements standard ACS

DNA_sequences_overlap_DynPhe.py implements dynamic pheromone tuning

DNA_sequences_overlap_Multi_Col.py implements multi-colony optimization

DNA_sequences_overlap_Hybrid.py implements the hybrid approach

DNA_sequences_overlap_Hybrid_SINGLE.py implements the hybrid approach for the biological sequences (takes a genetic sequence in input)
